'''
Below you are given the algorithm (in pseudocode) for two functions, main and doMath. Implement both in Python.

function main():
    get x from user
    get y from user
    call doMath(x,y)

function doMath(lhs, rhs):
    sum = lhs + rhs
    diff = lhs â€“ rhs
    product = lhs x rhs
    quotient = lhs / rhs
    display sum, diff, product, and quotient

Test the code with some simple values.
